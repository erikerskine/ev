A simple Drupal module to provide a quick way of displaying any entity using a given view mode.

Examples:
- http://localhost/ev/node/5/teaser
- http://localhost/ev/user/1/full

This module is designed to help with development only.
It doesn't necessarily honour permissions, etc.

__Don't use this on a production site.__
